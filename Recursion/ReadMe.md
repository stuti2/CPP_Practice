# Practice Programs

This section conatins the following programs:

- First occurance and last occurance
- Nth fibonacci number
- Print numbers till n
- Power of n
- Replace pi
- Reverse string
- Sort array
- Tower of hanoi
- Decode the string


### First occurance and last occurance

This program ([here](First_Occ_Last_Occ.cpp))prints first occurance and last occurance of a number, e.g.

```
./First-Occ-Last-Occ

Input: 2 3 4 5 6 4 2 3  2
Output: 0 7
```

### Nth-Fibonnaci-Number

This program ([here](Nth_Fibonnaci_Number.cpp)) takes input a number and prints the nth fibonacci number in the series, e.g.
```
./Nth-Fibonnaci-Number

Input: 5
Output: 3
```

### Power of n

This program ([here](Power_of_n.cpp)) takes input 2 numbers n and p, and prints n^p, e.g.

```
./Power-of-n

Input: 3 5
Output: 243
```

### Replace Pi

This program ([here](Replace_Pi.cpp)) takes input a string s and replaces all "pi" with 3.14, e.g.

 ```
 ./Replace-Pi
  
Input: s = "abcdpiefgpiijklpimnpiopi"
Output: "abcd3.14efg3.14ijkl3.14mn3.14o3.14"
```
 
 ### Reverse String
 
 This program ([here](Reverse_String_Recursion.cpp)) takes input a string and reverses it using recursion, e.g.
 
 ```
 ./Reverse-String-Recursion
 
 Input: abcdefgh
 Output: hgfedcba
 ```
 
 ### Sorted Array
 
 This program, ([here](Sorted_array.cpp)) sorts the array, e.g.
 
 ```
 ./Sorted-array
 
 Input: 2 3 6 4 9 18 1
 Output: 1 2 3 4 6 9 18
 ```
 
 ### Tower Of Hanoi
 
 This program, ([here](Tower_Of_Hanoi.cpp)) Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules: 

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 
 ```
 ./Tower-Of-Hanoi
 
Input : 3
Output : Move block 1 from A to C
          Move block 2 from A to B
          Move block 1 from C to B
          Move block 3 from A to C
          Move block 1 from B to A
          Move block 2 from B to C
          Move block 1 from A to C
 ```
### Decode the String
 
 In this program, ([here](Decode_the_String.cpp)) an encoded string (s) is given, the task is to decode it, e.g.
 
 ```
 ./Decode-the-String
 
 Input: 1
        3[b2[ca]]
 Output: bcacabcacabcaca
 ```
