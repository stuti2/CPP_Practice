# Practice Programs

This section conatins the following programs:

- Find two uniques in array
- Chcek if given number has alternate bits
- Convert binary to hexadecimal
- Print different characters in 2 strings
- Find complement of a number
- Check if a number is power of 2
- Check if a number is power of 4
- Reverse bits of a number
- Print subsets of array
- Total hamming distance
- Find unique number in array


### Two Uniques in Array

This program ([here](2Uniques_in_array.cpp))takes an input array and gives 2 unique numbers, e.g.

```
./Two-Uniques-in-Array

Input: 2 3 4 5 6 4 3 2
Output: 5 6
```

### Alternate Bits

This program ([here](Alternate_Bits.cpp)) takes input a number and checks whether it has alternate bits, e.g.

```
./Alternate-Bits

Input: 5
Output: True
```

### Binary to Hex

This program ([here](Bin_To_Hex.cpp)) takes input a number and converts it to hexadecimal, e.g.

```
./Bin-to-Hex

Input: 4366
Output: 110e
```

### Differnt Char in 2 Strings

This program ([here](Diff_char_in_2Strings.cpp)) takes input 2 string s and t. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t., e.g.

 ```
 ./Diff-char-in-2strings
  
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
```
